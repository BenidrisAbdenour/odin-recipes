    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This delicious thin crust pizza dough recipe is so low maintenance, you can throw it together in just 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Yeast:</strong>
            This thin crust pizza dough starts with one teaspoon of active dry yeast.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sugar and water:</strong>
            Activate the yeast in white sugar and lukewarm water.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Flour:</strong>
            This crispy thin crust calls for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Salt:</strong>
            Salt tightens the gluten structure, which strengthens the dough and makes it more elastic.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>

        <li>
            Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water that's 110 degrees F (44 degrees C) in a small bowl. Let stand until
            yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 8 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Combine 1 3/4 cups flour and salt in a large bowl. Pour in yeast mixture; mix well until dough comes
            together.
        </li>

        <li>
            Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if
            dough is too sticky.
        </li>

        <li>
            Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add your favorite toppings, and bake. Enjoy!
